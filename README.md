# Pizza-House
Welcome to Pizza House, a mock e-commerce website for a pizza restaurant. The website utilizes a variety of technologies and methodologies to create a seamless and enjoyable user experience. From the use of JSON and AJAX to asynchronously load data from our server, to the implementation of local storage to save user preferences, I have utilized a range of cutting-edge web development techniques to create a dynamic and responsive site. I also used DOM manipulation and BEM methodology to ensure clean and maintainable code, and I leveraged the power of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and engaging site that showcases our menu and allows users to easily place orders. I also incorporated Bootstrap 5 to ensure a responsive design across different devices and screen sizes, and I utilized expression functions, async/await, and DOM events to create a smooth and intuitive user experience. I hope you enjoy browsing my site.</br>
The website is designed by https://www.templatemonster.com/ and practiced by me.
